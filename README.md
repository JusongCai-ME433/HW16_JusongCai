# HW16_JusongCai

In HW16, Our goal is to make PI controller for wheel velocity. As instructed by schedule "MotorControl" web page, here are core harmony codes under the directory "firmware/src": "app.c/h" is the PI controller for wheel velocity and steering; "system_interrupt.c" under the directory "system_config/default", contains the interrupt function; "main.c" is the main function that controls "app.c".

As for soldering together the motor shield PCB, the result goes as a picture attached up on this repo.
